          My biggest interest is in creating 
          digital experiences in both physical and virtual space. I hope to inspire those 
          who interact with these experiences to leave with the same curiosity that I have for 
          almost everything, wondering:
        </p>
        <strong>"How does that work?"</strong> 
        <p>
          I like to make things with code that can't be done any other way, playing into the nature 
          of the medium and exploring the possibilities that come with it. I delve into the base 
          components of images and reinterpret them based on that information, reimagining the way 
          they're displayed and exposing the nature of their construction. I have a few of those 
          projects <a href="pages/tools.html">here</a>.

        <strong>analog screen (self-portrait)</strong> <i>hand-cut polarized film mosaic</i> 2022
      </h1>
      <p>
        <i>Analog Screen</i> was my second foray into polarized film mosaics. It was my final project 
        for a drawing class, where I somehow convinced the professor that the work fit the critera of 
        the assignment, even though there was absolutely zero drawing involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's not to say that there wasn't any work put in. I switched to this idea for the project 
        with just above 48 hours left until the due date. 19 of those hours went into this self-portrait. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar to the other self-portrait I had to make that quarter, I did what I could to obscure my 
        features. Along with the pixellation, the work is just a silhouette unless you view it through a 
        polarizing filter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tiles were cut out with a square hole punch and adhered to drawing paper. Each tile is 0.25 
        inches square.
