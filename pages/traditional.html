              <p>
                <i>Cursor</i> was the second plate I ever worked on, but it was the last one that I 
                finished.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project started, without my knowledge, when I cut upwards of a hundred tiny paper 
                arrows meant to resemble the ubiquitous mouse cursor icon that we see nearly every 
                time we use a computer. I wanted to have these because I felt that they were significant, 
                and because seeing lots of them at once usually means that your computer is glitching out.
              </p>
              <p>
                I rolled the paper cursors through a printing press to imprint their silhouette on 
                my plate through a soft ground. I had to go back and trace their outlines later to 
                make them visible in print. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, I added the lettering through a mix of drypoint etching and deep etching, 
                resulting in an open bite.

              <p>
                <i>Facefall</i> was my final project for a color theory class. 
              </p>
              <p>
                In class, we had a little photoshoot for our self-portraits, and none of the photos 
                taken of me were any good. I decided to use the worst photo of the bunch and ended 
                up going back to an old code project to mess with it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The program takes all pixels above a certain brightness and shifts them upwards, 
                letting the pixels above fall down below. It tends to behead (white) people 
                because their skin is usually brighter than their clothes.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the time that I made this, I hated having my picture taken, let alone having to 
                spend hours slaving over a monument to my own face. I had gone through every option 
                available to me in a self-portrait setting to avoid drawing my own face. This was no 
                different. It's still fun to look back on works like this now though.

              <h1>
                <strong>liquid crystal</strong> <i>projector, broken screens, polarized film (installation)</i> 2021
              </h1>
              <p>
                <i>Liquid crystal</i> is an installation piece done for my senior IB art show at a local gallery.
              </p>
              <p>
                This work stemmed from my interest in the patterns and ripples that would appear when you squished 
                the screen of your calculator or laptop screen. I did a lot of research into the technology behind 
                these screens, after I had already taken apart several of them with no knowledge of how they worked.
              </p>
              <p>
                The magic ingredient of these screens is called <i>liquid crystal</i>, and it works to bend the light 
                between two sheets of polarized film. In this way, it blocks light from coming through specific areas 
                of the screen, allowing images and numbers to be displayed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each piece of the work was sourced from sellers online. The projector was from a father on Craigslist, 
                who's daughter used to use it to project sketches for her murals. The screens were from a lot of ten
                calculators labelled as "for parts" on eBay, even though all of them still worked, they were just 
                missing their batteries. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I chose this type of projector because it meant that I could have the physical screen in the gallery 
                alongside a dynamic larger representation of itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may notice that the projected image is different in nearly all the photos I have, and that is 
                because the projector emits enough heat to change the viscosity of the liquid crystal, affecting 
                the image. In the gallery, the projector is off until someone comes up and presses the button to 
                turn it on. Depending on how recently it was used and for how long, the spectator will see a different 
                image.
